    <p>Hey its zane, rn its 12:30am now of 16th june. today (yesterday) was a really good start day where i learnt about tilemap and collisons and sprite and tilemap
      tho i accidently made the background and ground tile in one tilemap causing the charecter to be stuck in walls, sucks ik but im pretty impressed i even pulled something off like that using tile palette and stuff
      well, ill be redoing the tile map and make seperate the two. also i was actually able to draw some good 16x16 bits pixel art but i think i made the slimes bigger than the mc itslef lol. ill see what i might be able to do with it
      alright.
      signing off.
